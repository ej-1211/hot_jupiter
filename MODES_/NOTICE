Development of the MODES software version 1.0 as an open-access tool at UL-FMF was funded 
by the European Research Council, grant agreement no. 280153, 2012-2016.

The computation of the Hough harmonics and the vertical structure functions in the terrain-following 
sigma coordinate was written after the original code from the National Center for Atmospheric Research 
(NCAR), Boulder, CO, USA, originally developed by Akira Kasahara.

Besides the above citation, users are furthermore kindly asked to point inquires for MODES to the MODES webpage 
http://modes.cen.uni-hamburg.de 

Users are also kindly asked to register journal articles and scientific documents that use MODES via email to: modes.mi@uni-hamburg.de and to contribute their MODES-related tool such as visualization of MODES outputs and pre-processing of input data for MODES. 

Citing the Software Documentation Paper and registering your paper(s) will serve to document the scientific impact 
of the software, which is of vital importance for securing its further development. 
You should consider this an obligation if you have taken advantage of the software, which represents the end product 
of a considerable effort by a number of scientists over many years. 
To contribute to MODES development, please contact Dr. Nedjeljka Žagar, nedjeljka.zagar@uni-hamburg.de.
